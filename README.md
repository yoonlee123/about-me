- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam Lee.
- 👀 I’m interested to learn more about machine learning algorithms to better understand how systems behave and when they might fail.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills in python and SQL, and I hope to learn a wide variety of programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project with anyone in any given opportunity!
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: yoonlee123@outlook
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am rolling stock engineer who is fascinated by data analytics and the value it provides to most efficiently maintain and operate the trains.
